Allocator override (speex_lib_ctl)
Better error handling
Fixed-point:
  - Wideband
  - Initialization
  - Jitter buffer
Echo cancellation:
  - Int array for denoiser hooks
Denoiser:
  - Smooth gain (remove musical noise)
  - Better noise adaptation
  - Do some tuning
AGC:
  - Use median filtering instead of "non-linear mean"



Features
-Add maximum/minimum bit-rate control for VBR
-Improve error handling (with perror-like call?)

Long-term quality improvements
-Improve perceptual enhancement (including wideband)

Standards
-Complete Speex RTP profile
-MIME type registration

ideas:
Peelable stream (double codebook, higher bands, stereo)
LPC from spectral domain
Better psycho-acoustic model. Masking curve from Vorbis?
